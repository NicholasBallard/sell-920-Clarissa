Remember why I am doing this...
Selling 920 Clarissa for 250K+ means

What happens if I don't sell:

--going back every year to slave on the place
--deal with tenants
--have to keep advertising the thing
--risk losing money from bad tenants
--risk of a tenant hurting himself


What happens if I do:

--getting D out of debt immediately
--I get out of debt immediately
--no more house to manage
--no more advertising for tenants
--good deal for an investor
